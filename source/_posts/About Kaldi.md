Speech recognition:
	• HMM decoder using WFST transducers
	• keyword search based on WFSTs
	• Acoustic models: GMM, SGMM, DNN (nnet1,2,3) (DNN types: feed-forward, Convolutional, LSTM, BLSTM)
	• Language models: N-GRAM, RNNLM
	• speaker adaptation techniques (CMVN, VTLN, fMLLR, iVector based)
	• sequence-discriminative training bMMI, sMBR (global optimization instead of ‘per-frame’ training)
Kaldi is similar in aims and scope to HTK.
